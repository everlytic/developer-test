    <h1 id="davids-notes">David's Notes</h1>
    <h2 id="general-notes">General notes</h2>
    <p>I made a new model instead of using Laravel's built in User object because the kind of user that we are creating
        isn't really in that style, (for example they don't have a password or a log in middleware etc), and I called
        that model UserListing. All this tinkering is probably causing me to lose points now that I think about it, but
        yolo.</p>
    <h2 id="repositories">Repositories</h2>
    <p>In this example because its such a small test set up the whole repository structure is way overkill and just
        makes the code more complicated to read than anything else. I inherited a project at a previous job where the
        dev went just absolutely wild with repos for every little thing and it make debugging and fixing the code really
        irritating. So I might have a bit of a PTSD bias for repos. Nevertheless I followed one style of repositories
        that I find the least annoying. Obviously when a project is big enough repositories is the way to go, otherwise
        you would have code duplicated all over the place.</p>
    <h2 id="javascript">Javascript</h2>
    <p>You might notice my javascipt if you take a look into the file is quite messy, I did this because I just wanted
        to have the working structure of the assignment working as per spec, but I don't think you will be focusing on
        the javascript side of things. If I were to have a need to neaten up the javascript I definitely could, and
        would if you would like me to (just to prove that I am indeed capable of writing clean javascript)</p>
    <h2 id="using-google-fonts-and-font-awesome">Using google fonts and font awesome</h2>
    <p>I assume this use of mine was okay as the instructions only said to not use bootstrap, so I get the sense that
        you aren't really looking for too much front end analysis. I simply used google fonts because I like open sans
        and I used font awesome because it was the easiest way to use the trashcan icon. However if needed I could
        adjust that to not make any use of any external libraries, bring my own font, or use a system one, and get my
        own icon for the trashcan image. Also even if using libraries is fine, I would ideally do a pull of those files
        locally so that we wouldn't have to rely on a cdn that adds an extra request to the site, and could go down
        outside of our control.</p>
    <h2>Testing</h2>
    <p>Regarding the testing task with phpunit, with laravel I usually use Laravel Dusk and do browser tests to ensure
        that the code works, which uses phpunit as the underlying system as well as selenium for the browser part, but I
        can also write more basic database tests like these: https://laravel.com/docs/5.5/database-testing However it
        isn't specified which kind of test should be done in this case. I didn't want to waste either of our time in
        writing the wrong kind of tests, so if you want just clarify with me what kind of tests you mean and I will get
        those done ASAP.</p>
